/**

 It is not necessary to have a main() method in the class to start a JavaFX application.
 When you run a Java class that inherits from the Application class, the java
 command launches the JavaFX application if the class being run does not contain
 the main() method.
 â€¢	 If you include a main() method in the JavaFX application class inside the main()
 method, call the launch() static method of the Application class to launch the
 application. The launch() method takes a String array as an argument, which are
 the parameters passed to the JavaFX application.
